# Library API

Build a simple restful API for a library application. With this API, a user should be able to add a
book, view a book, view all books, and delete a book. A user should also be able to borrow and return a
book to the library.

## Brief
The library is available for the public. The public can view books, borrow books and return books. The admin can be able to add books to the collection.
